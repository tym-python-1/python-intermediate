# Instructions 

1. In the `main.py` file, we will be adding exception handling to the diary exercise
2. Attempt to open the file in append mode
3. Attempt to get the diary entry
4. Handle the case where user interrupts the input (e.g., Ctrl+C)
5. Add a general exception for unexpected issues during input handling
6. Add other exceptions, similar to the previous 2 exercises

# Hints
1. Use keywords like try and except
2. When handling the case where the user interrupts the input, use break



## Test Your Code

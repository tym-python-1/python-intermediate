# We can store data into variables
first_name = "Tom"
last_name = "Tan"

# We can then use the + operator to concatenate strings (You will learn more about this later)
# Try changing the strings stored in the first_name and last_name variables to your own and
# run the program to see what happens!
print("My name is " + first_name + " " + last_name)


## Variables Naming
# # (1): variable name must start with a letter or underscore character
# my_age = 14
# _my_age = 15
# print(my_age)
# print(_my_age)

## (2): variable name cannot start with numbers
# 1st_name = "Tom"

## (3): variable names can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores
# first$name = "Tim"

## (4): variable names are case sensitive
# my_name = "Jenny"
# My_name = "James"
# print("The variable my_name stores {}".format(my_name))
# print("The variable My_name stores {}".format(My_name))

## (5): Cannot use keywords/functions as variable names
# print = "Print Function"
# input = "Input Function"
# print(print)

## (6): variable names cannot have spaces between words
# my first name = "Thomas"

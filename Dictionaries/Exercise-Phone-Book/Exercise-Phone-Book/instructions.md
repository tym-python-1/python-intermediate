# Instructions

1. Given the dictionary of people's phone numbers, use a `for` loop to create a new dictionary of everyone's number for people whose name begins with a 'J'.
2. Add a new person Jerome, whose number is 98765432
3. Fill up the lookup_number function which helps to retrieve the person's number based on a user's input

# Hints
1. Create an empty dictionary to add the key-value pair of people whose name begins with a 'J'
2. Loop through the key and value pairs of the original dictionary
3. Check if the first letter of the name starts with a 'J' by using string indexing

## Example
### Example Input
```python
What name would you like to look up? Jerry
What name would you like to look up? Jerome
```
### Example Output
```python
'Sorry, that name is not in the phonebook.'
'The number for Jerome is 98765432'
```

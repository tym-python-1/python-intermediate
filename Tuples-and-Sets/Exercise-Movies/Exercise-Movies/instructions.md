# Instructions 

1. In your `main.py` file, create the remaining 2 tuples for movies. Each movie has the following format: Movie Title, Year of Release, and Genre.
2. The second movie is "The Dark Knight", released in 2008, and is in the Action genre.
3. The third movie is "Inception", released in 2010, and is in the Sci-Fi genre.
4. Create a tuple of tuples for the movies given.
5. Filter movies that are after the year 2000, and display the title and year only using a for loop and tuple slicing.


# Hints
1. Tuples use round brackets ().
2. Use the variables of the movies to add it into the movie_library variable.
3. Use the correct index when checking for the year of the movie.
4. For list slicing, remember that the second index is not included.

## Example
### Example Output
```python
Combined Inventory: {'Apples': 60, 'Bananas': 30, 'Oranges': 20, 'Pineapples': 20, 'Pears': 30, 'Grapes': 55}
Restock Items: {'Oranges': 20, 'Pineapples': 20}
Large Stock Items: {'Apples': 60, 'Grapes': 55}
Sorted Inventory: {'Oranges': 20, 'Pineapples': 20, 'Bananas': 30, 'Pears': 30, 'Grapes': 55, 'Apples': 60}
```

## Test Your Code
### Running Tests
- To verify your program, run it and check if it provides the correct output based on the input.

## Final Note
- Before submitting, make sure that your program correctly asks for the user's name, forms the greeting and prints it to the console.

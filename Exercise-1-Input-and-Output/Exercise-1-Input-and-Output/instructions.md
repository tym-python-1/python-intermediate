# Instructions
1. In your `main.py` file, write a program that asks the user for their name using the `input` function.
2. The program should then print out a greeting using the provided name, in the format `Hello <user_input>`.

## Example
### Example Input
```plaintext
John
```
### Example Output
```plaintext
Hello John
```

## Hint
1. Use the `input` function to take the user's name as input.
2. Concatenate "Hello " with the user input to form the greeting.
3. Use the `print` function to output the greeting to the console.

## Test Your Code
### Running Tests
- To verify your program, run it and check if it provides the correct output based on the input.

## Final Note
- Before submitting, make sure that your program correctly asks for the user's name, forms the greeting and prints it to the console.

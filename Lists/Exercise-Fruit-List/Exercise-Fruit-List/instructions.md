# Instructions

1. In your `main.py` file, prompt the user to give you 4 fruits and create a list of the first 3 fruits.
2. `append` the fourth fruit in the list, and `remove` the fruit at index 1.
3. Print the first and last fruit in the list.
4. Modify the list to display every fruit in upper case using list comprehensions.
5. Print each fruit using a `for` loop.

## Example
### Example Input
```python
Enter the first fruit: banana
Enter the second fruit: pear
Enter the third fruit: pineapple
Enter the fourth fruit: orange
```
### Example Output
```python
'The first fruit in the list is banana'
'The last fruit in the list is orange'
'BANANA'
'PINEAPPLE'
'ORANGE'
```


## Hints
1. Create 4 variables and use the `input` function.
2. The index of the first element is 0.
3. Use the `.upper()` method to display a fruit in upper case.
4. For list comprehensions, the output that we want is placed in front of the `for` loop.
5. When using `for` loops, we need a variable to describe an element in the list.



## Test Your Code
### Running Tests
- To verify your program, run it and check if it provides the correct output based on the input.

## Final Note
- Before submitting, make sure that your program correctly asks for the user's name, forms the greeting and prints it to the console.

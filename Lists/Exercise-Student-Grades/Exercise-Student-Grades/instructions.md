# Instructions

1. In your `main.py` file, find the average of each student's grades. An element in the grades list represent the grades of one student.
2. `append` the average grades into a new average_grade list.
3. Sort the list in descending order, from the highest average grade to lowest.
4. Print out the average grades in 2 decimal places with a for loop and the round function.

## Example
### Example Output
```python
91.99
82.21
85.67
99.84
```


## Hints
1. The outer loop loops through each student, and the inner loop loops through each grade for a student.
2. Be careful of the indentations! Should you append the grade in the inner or outer loop?
3. Sort using the sort function, and ensure that reverse = true.


## Test Your Code
### Running Tests
- To verify your program, run it and check if it provides the correct output based on the input.

## Final Note
- Before submitting, make sure that your program correctly asks for the user's name, forms the greeting and prints it to the console.
